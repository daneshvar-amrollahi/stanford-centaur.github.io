Membership
----------

Members who join in this academic year (2021-2022) will be permanently archived
as *founding* members of the center.

Our corporate members are a vital and integral part of Centaur.  Not only do
membership fees provide essential funding for the center's activities, but
members also have the opportunity to pose research challenges from the real
world and collaborate with the center on solutions.

It is the intention of all Centaur researchers that any software developed will be released under a corporate-friendly open-source model, such as the 3-clause BSD license. Companies may provide additional funding above the membership fee to support extra effort on shared research goals.  As with other Centaur research, any results from such additional funding will be shared publicly.
