  excerpt: "Partitioning is a divide-and-conquer approach where a difficult problem is split into hopefully easier subproblems that can be solved in parallel. This strategy is notoriously difficult to get right with SMT problems. We found that while itâ€™s no panacea, partitioning can be used to diversify solving and reliably improve performance in a portfolio."

  excerpt: "cvc5 is an SMT solver with support for many theories: integers, reals, bit-vectors, algebraic datatypes, separation logic, sets, bags, and more. This means that is can find satisfying solutions for formulas involving these kinds of objects. In this post, I explain the process of adding a new theory to cvc5: the theory of prime-order finite fields."
